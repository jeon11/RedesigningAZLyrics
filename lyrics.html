                <br>
                I used to rule the world<br>
                Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
                Now in the morning I sleep alone<br>
                Sweep the streets I used to own<br>
                <br>
                I used to roll the dice<br>
                Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br>
                Listened as the crowd would sing,<br>
                "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"<br>
                One minute I held the key<br>
                Next the walls were closed on me<br>
                And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
                Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br>
                <br>
                I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
                Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
                Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
                My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
                For some reason I can't explain<br>
                Once you'd gone there was never<br>
                Never an honest word<br>
                And that was when I ruled the world<br>
                <br>
                It was a wicked and wild wind<br>
                Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
                Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
                People couldn't believe what I'd become<br>
                Revolutionaries wait<br>
                For my head on a silver plate<br>
                Just a puppet on a lonely string<br>
                Oh who would ever want to be king?<br>
                <br>
                I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
                Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
                Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
                My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
                For some reason I can't explain<br>
                I know St. Peter won't call my name<br>
                Never an honest word<br>
                But that was when I ruled the world<br>
                <br>
                Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [5x]<br>
                <br>
                Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
                Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
                Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
                My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
                For some reason I can't explain<br>
                I know St. Peter won't call my name<br>
                Never an honest word<br>
                But that was when I ruled the world<br>
